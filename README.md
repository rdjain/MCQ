This a code for msp430g2553 based MCQ answering machine which calculates the results in the end and displays it on a 16x2 LCD.
The code involves use of ultra low power mode of msp series of controllers hence rendering a relly good battery life.
The procedure followed to evaluate marks is pretty inefficient and so please feel free to alter the code.
